With over 3,000 participants from 26 countries, San Jose’s 26st marathon includes distances of 10k, 21k and 42k, as well as a 5k run/walk for children, seniors and people with disabilities.


Over 12 million colones ($22 thousand dollars) in prizes will be distributed among winners in the different categories; an additional bonus of 1 million colones goes to a runner who beats San José's current full-marathon record - 2 hours, 17 minutes and 27 seconds.


Other prizes include T-shirts and medals.


Entry costs vary from 10,000 colones ($18) for the 5k race/walk to 25,000 colones ($44) for the 42k marathon; hydration and insurance are included in the race, which is electronically timed.

**When** Sunday, December 4th 


**Where** National Stadium
