A craft brewery, restaurant and live music venue, Cantina SCCA is located in an antique house, where it hosts weekly events including taco and jazz nights as well as tributes to late musicians. 


Since the house was transformed into a bar, it has adopted the phrase “hasta la muerte”, meaning “to the bitter end”, since a famous Costa Rican doctor was vengefully murdered there in 1938.
