A rooftop cocktail lounge with a view of San Jose, Selv√°tica Social Club hosts DJ sets on Friday nights, and during Saturday and Sunday brunches.

The bar serves classic cocktails alongside house creations like the Artichoke Hold, which mixes spiced rum with artichoke and elderflower liqueurs, orgeat and lemon.
