Featuring Latin American artists, including Jos√© Sancho, Max Jimenez, Francisco Zuniga and Jorge Jimenez Deredia, the Costa Rican Art Museum has more than 6,000 pieces of art in a variety of forms.
Visitors can view pieces as far back as the early 19th century, in addition to an international collection of more than 560 pieces of contemporary art.
Guests can also visit the sculpture garden outside, and learn about art history upstairs through visuals of the pre-Columbian Indigenous peoples and a mural by French artist Louis Feron.
Regular events and concerts are scheduled throughout the season.
