Founded in 1905, Cantina Buenos Aires is known for its drinks, including the “Turkish Blood” cocktail, made with red wine, ice, lemon and “guaro” - a typical Latin American liquor made from sugar cane. 

An iconic bar in San Jose, Cantina Buenos Aires is a favorite locale for the Who's Who in everything from art to politics.
