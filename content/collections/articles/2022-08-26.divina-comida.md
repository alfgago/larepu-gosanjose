Divina Comida is “Divine Food” in Spanish, that is what chef/proprietor Marco Antonio Guzmán is seeking to achieve with a fusion of Peruvian and Creole cuisine.

His dishes take advantage of seasonal ingredients and the catch of the day. 

Divina Comida has a commitment to the principles of sustainability and responsible consumption, this is accomplished by meticulously choosing the source of their food, working with artisanal fishermen, and helping to promote the conservation of marine species.
