Celebrating a national tradition, the parade brings together “Boyeros” – farmers with oxcarts – from all over the country, who have created an artform through the decoration of wheels and of the cart itself,  with a great variety of colors and designs.

 

A tradition recognized by UNESCO as part of the world’s cultural heritage, the boyeros for over a century were the main system for bringing agricultural products, especially coffee, to the country’s markets.

 

Held since 1997 in downtown San José, the parade encourages development of the craft by highlighting the work of artisans who reinforce Costa Rican history.

 

**When** Sunday, November 26, 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.

 

**Where** Starts at the Eastern Side of la Sabana and ends in Plaza de la Democracia
