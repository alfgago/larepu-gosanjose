The Jade Museum holds the largest collection of Pre-Columbian Jade in America. 

It contains five thematic rooms for permanent exhibitions, where the ancient history of Costa Rica is narrated from an archaeological interpretation, in which social, religious and daily aspects of the people who made and used them are highlighted.

It also has two temporary exposition halls for topics related to national and international human cultural activities, including samples of visual arts and archeology. 

Conferences and educational events are held weekly, on topics such as ancient economics and trade.
