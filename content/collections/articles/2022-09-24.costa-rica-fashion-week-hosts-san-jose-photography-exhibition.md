Fashion photos turn San José into an open-air gallery, until October 12.

The exhibition is the result of the “Fashion in my Region” contest, developed to create recognition for photographers, students and fans of the Costa Rican design industry, while portraying national culture. 

The work of ten participants has been displayed on billboards and marquees across the capital, all with  a theme of “The wonderful portrait of an innovative identity”. 

The winner of this edition was Gabriel Loría, with their work "Unique", a portrait of editorial makeup, with a striking color palette.
