For more than 50 years Veritas University has trained students to become both nationally and internationally recognized designers. 

As members of the LCI Education Network, the institution instructs design professionals who stand out for their global vision.

International students are offered a variety of options to help them adapt to their new home away from home including accommodation for foreign students and immigration assistance during the immigration process. 

They are also offered a transfer of credits from their previous studies. 

Academic programs include bachelor degrees in photography, animation, film, design, and advertising, among others.
