ARTFLOW Gallery is an artistic platform which produces exhibitions and educational activities.
 
It represents a broad group of up and coming contemporary creators at a national and international level, with an emphasis on Latin American production. 

The gallery has established itself as a meeting point for artists, collectors, philanthropists and art lovers in the region.
 
It also manages the Artwalk, an event where art, design and national products are synchronized to create a space in which a wide and diverse public converges.

Their work follows the values and characteristics of the Central American context in which it is found: dynamism, exploration, interaction and persistence.
