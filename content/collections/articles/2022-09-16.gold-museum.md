The Gold Museum displays the development of Costa Rica’s multiethnic and multicultural society through nine thematic units, pre-Columbian objects and educational resources. 

The modules reflect on the Indigenous people of America and migration, mining and metallurgical production, the ancestral and current cosmovision of the indigenous, their human relationship with nature, their vision of gender and the historical impact of the colony and the conquest.

Nearly 700 pieces of pre-Columbian gold are displayed, in addition to ceramic and lithic pieces from various regions of the country and periods of history.
