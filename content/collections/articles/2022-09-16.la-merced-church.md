Built in 1894, The Church of La Merced with its Gothic-German design is part of Costa Rica's historical-architectural heritage. 

Several works of art can be found inside, including three stained-glass windows that represent the apparition of the Virgen de las Mercedes, and a sculpture of the Agonizing Christ, the work of Manuel María Zúñiga.
