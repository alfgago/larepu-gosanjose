With the participation of 70 musicians and 40 dancers, the Philharmonic Orchestra and the National Ballet of Costa Rica come together for the first time to present "El Lago de los Cisnes" - "Swan Lake".

“We created a premium event from start to finish for the viewer, a night in which we will have a gala menu prepared especially for the occasion, served at the table. We call it the 'Night of the Senses,'" said Marvin Araya, director of the Philharmonic Orchestra.

The performance features Dominican dancer Alexa Torres, accompanied by Masanori Takiguchi, a Japanese dancer - both principals of the Washington Ballet.

"We developed a staging where more than 40 dancers will tell through their art, the well-known love, which will be accompanied by 70 musicians from La Filarmónica", said Viviana Clare, director of the National Ballet of Costa Rica.
