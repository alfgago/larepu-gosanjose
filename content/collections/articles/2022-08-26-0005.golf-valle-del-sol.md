Designed by North American architect Tracy May, the 18-hole golf course has 7,000 yards of fairways surrounded by trees, lakes and a diverse wildlife.

Each hole offers several tees for different levels of play, from beginners to professionals.

Golf Valle del Sol hosts both amateur and professional golf tournaments for adults, as well as lessons for children and teens.
